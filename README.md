## Software that we have made major contributions to
### FIRST Tech Challenge Robot Controller app
REV Robotics regularly contributes improvements to the Robot Controller and Driver Station apps
used in the FIRST Tech Challenge competition. While the Driver Station app is not open-source,
the Robot Controller app's source code is shipped in source JAR files, which are regularly extracted
to the following GitHub repository (which is not an official FIRST property):

[OpenFTC/Extracted-RC](https://github.com/OpenFTC/Extracted-RC)

### The Orange Alliance Event Management System
While the Event Management System is currently maintained by [The Orange Alliance](https://theorangealliance.org/),
it was originally developed by REV Robotics for FIRST Global 2018 and 2019.

## Assorted projects
### FTC Robocol Wireshark plugin
Wireshark is a network packet analysis tool, and we developed a
[Wireshark plugin](https://github.com/REVrobotics/FTC-robocol-Wireshark-plugin) that allows you to
analyze the FTC network traffic (called Robocol) between the Robot Controller and Driver Station
apps. For this to work, you must know the password to the robot's WiFi network.
